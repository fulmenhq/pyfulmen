# PyFulmen Logging Guide

This guide has been restructured into topical documents for easier navigation.

**📖 [Go to the new Logging Guide →](logging/README.md)**

## Quick Links

- **[Quick Start](logging/README.md)** - Get started in 5 minutes
- **[Profiles](logging/profiles.md)** - SIMPLE, STRUCTURED, ENTERPRISE, CUSTOM
- **[Middleware](logging/middleware.md)** - Correlation, redaction, throttling (with correct configuration examples)

## What Changed

The comprehensive logging guide has been split into focused topics:

- **`logging/README.md`** - Overview and quick start
- **`logging/profiles.md`** - Detailed profile documentation
- **`logging/middleware.md`** - Middleware configuration (with corrected examples)
- More guides coming soon (configuration, sinks, policy, etc.)

This makes it easier to find specific information without scrolling through a 600+ line document.

**Note**: The old comprehensive guide is preserved as `logging.md.OLD` for reference.
