## 🏢 Contribution Guidelines

### For Human Contributors

1. **Architecture Changes**: Discuss with @3leapsdave before implementation
2. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure changes align with FulmenHQ ecosystem standards
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs and examples
4. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage with proper isolation and mocking
5. **Code Quality**: Follow Python best practices and pass all quality gates
6. **Performance**: Measure and document overhead for performance-sensitive changes
7. **Quality Assurance**:
   - All tests must pass before PR submission
   - No test failures may be dismissed without root cause resolution
   - Performance impact must be measured and documented
   - Code must maintain enterprise-grade reliability standards

### For AI Agents

1. **Identity Confirmation**: Always use assigned identity from `MAINTAINERS.md`
2. **Human Oversight**: Tag @3leapsdave for significant architectural decisions
3. **Safety Protocols**: Follow `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md` for all operations
4. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness over speed in all implementations
5. **Ecosystem Thinking**: Consider impact on other \*fulmen libraries
6. **Test Accountability**:
   - Never dismiss test failures as "pre-existing issues" without proper investigation
   - Always perform root cause analysis for failing tests
   - Ensure all mocks properly reflect actual imports and dependencies
   - Verify comprehensive test coverage before declaring work complete
7. **Performance Standards**:
   - Measure overhead for all performance-sensitive operations
   - Target < 1% performance impact for telemetry instrumentation
   - Document performance characteristics in implementation notes
8. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Update all relevant documentation when implementing features
   - Provide clear examples for developers
   - Maintain consistency with ecosystem standards
9. **Quality Gate Compliance**:
   - Run `make precommit` for all interim deliveries and commit reviews
   - Run `make prepush` for final release commits
   - All pre-commit/prepush issues must be fixed before proceeding
   - No exceptions without explicit maintainer approval
   - Restage files after fixes and re-run quality gates

## 📞 Communication Channels

### Primary Channels

- **Development**: `#pyfulmen-development` (Mattermost)
- **Architecture**: `#fulmen-architecture` (cross-language coordination)
- **Releases**: `#fulmen-releases` (announcements)
- **Incidents**: `#fulmen-incidents` (critical issues)

### Issue Management

- **Bug Reports**: Use GitHub Issues with appropriate labels
- **Feature Requests**: Discuss in `#pyfulmen-development` before creating issues
- **Security Issues**: Report privately to maintainers@3leaps.net

### Review Process

## 🔄 Release Process

### Version Strategy

- **Development**: Semantic versioning for API compatibility
- **Documentation**: Always updated with release notes
- **Quality Gates**:
  - All tests must pass (100% pass rate required)
  - Linting and type checking must be clean
  - Performance impact must be measured and within acceptable bounds
  - No test failures may be ignored or dismissed without resolution
  - Code coverage must be maintained or improved
  - **Pre-Commit Process**:
    - For interim deliveries (pre-audit) and commit review stages: `make precommit` must pass
    - All pre-commit issues must be fixed (with files restaged) or get maintainer approval as exception
    - For final release commits: `make prepush` must pass (includes additional release-specific checks)
    - No commits may proceed without passing pre-commit/prepush gates unless explicitly approved
- **Release Coordination**: Align with other \*fulmen libraries when possible

### Release Authority

- **Final Approval**: @3leapsdave has final release authority
- **Emergency Releases**: Can be executed by any maintainer with proper justification
- **Post-Release**: Monitor for issues and provide rapid response
